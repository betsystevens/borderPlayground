I'm so happy I signed up for this course. I have not been disappointed.
Josh had a Border Playground widget to demonstrate different kinds of borders.  
For fun I re-created his widget using HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.  
I pretty much kept his design to the pixel, at least it looks pretty darn close.

- todo
  - add style to checked color radio button
  - make responsive.
